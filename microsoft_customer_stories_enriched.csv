But, even after decades in the industry, there is still room for a fresh challenge, like when the airline was asked to help coordinate a “civilian air activation” and help move Afghan refugees out of the Middle East and Germany. When Harel Magaritz, Managing Director of Network Operation Center, Daily Operation at United Airlines, remembers the event, he calls it “one of the more remarkable things we’ve ever done.” The story he shares is a testament to teamwork. “In August of 2021, United Airlines gathered 250 employees in Microsoft Teams to coordinate the civilian air activation,” he says. Over a period of nearly two months, employees from across United collaborated in Teams to arrange a total of 70 flights, all while continuing to run a worldwide airline. Ultimately, the effort helped assist some 10,000 refugees. “We had multiple Teams channels going 24 hours a day,” says Magaritz. “It was phenomenal, getting everyone together in real time to make sure no information was missed and support was constantly there.” Everything from providing coloring books for young passengers to sourcing Gatorade for dehydrated guests was discussed in Teams, along with the paperwork and logistics needed for such an operation. Without Teams, the undertaking would have been significantly more challenging, notes Magaritz. “If we didn’t have Teams, this mission would have involved hundreds of emails and phone calls,” he says. “Would we have completed the missions? Yes, but it would have been nowhere near the product and level of collaboration we delivered with Teams.”",United Airlines,"Azure AI Bot Service, Microsoft 365 Enterprise, Microsoft Graph, Microsoft Teams, Microsoft Teams Rooms",United States,Employee experience,"10,000+ employees"

Remote condition monitoring is a key part of keeping those operations running efficiently, but the exponential growth in the number of sensors and data they collect has made it a challenge to extract value from the information in a timely way. By moving its orchestration and operation of remote condition monitoring applications to Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Edge Essentials, ABB has a single end-to-end Kubernetes solution that helps unify edge and cloud assets to streamline application development and simplify deployment and management. As a result, ABB only needs to create one version of applications that can run on Windows, Linux, and in the cloud. This significantly reduces development and deployment time and frees resources to create even more effective AI-driven data analysis solutions from all the rich data collected from large manufacturing operations. Reduced administration requirements also allow ABB to handle a rapidly expanding edge ecosystem with a shrinking number of available workers.",ABB,"Azure, Azure Kubernetes Service Edge Essentials",Switzerland,Modern infrastructure,"10,000+ employees"
