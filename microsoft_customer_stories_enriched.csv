Turning gas into cash: N-ERGIE’s virtual power plant based on Azure helps market electricity made from biogas,N/A,https://www.microsoft.com/en/customers/story/1477261872975555769-n-ergie-azure-en,"When cattle eat grass, they produce organic material: manure. And when this ferments, you get biogas. Burning biogas in a combined heat and power (CHP) plant is a way to generate clean electricity. For a long time, Germany’s farmers could turn a profit by producing electricity this way because for over 20 years the country’s Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) guaranteed them stable sales prices for it. But with the phasing out of this remuneration, the job of marketing electricity is once again falling to the plant operations. A complex undertaking. To ensure incentives to operate such plants remain, N-ERGIE Aktiengesellschaft developed a virtual power plant based on the Azure cloud platform. This allows decentralized management of CHP plants to keep them running at maximum efficiency. It also means operators get the best possible market price.",N/A,,N/A,N/A,N/A

But, even after decades in the industry, there is still room for a fresh challenge, like when the airline was asked to help coordinate a “civilian air activation” and help move Afghan refugees out of the Middle East and Germany. When Harel Magaritz, Managing Director of Network Operation Center, Daily Operation at United Airlines, remembers the event, he calls it “one of the more remarkable things we’ve ever done.” The story he shares is a testament to teamwork. “In August of 2021, United Airlines gathered 250 employees in Microsoft Teams to coordinate the civilian air activation,” he says. Over a period of nearly two months, employees from across United collaborated in Teams to arrange a total of 70 flights, all while continuing to run a worldwide airline. Ultimately, the effort helped assist some 10,000 refugees. “We had multiple Teams channels going 24 hours a day,” says Magaritz. “It was phenomenal, getting everyone together in real time to make sure no information was missed and support was constantly there.” Everything from providing coloring books for young passengers to sourcing Gatorade for dehydrated guests was discussed in Teams, along with the paperwork and logistics needed for such an operation. Without Teams, the undertaking would have been significantly more challenging, notes Magaritz. “If we didn’t have Teams, this mission would have involved hundreds of emails and phone calls,” he says. “Would we have completed the missions?
